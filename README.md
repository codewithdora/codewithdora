## Hi there, my name is Isadora. Welcome to my profile! â˜•
- You can refer to me using the pronouns **she/her**.
- Lately, I've been studying **Java, C++ and Python**.
- I'm a Computer Science student at **Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF)**.
- Honestly, I'm pretty interested in some areas like **AI, Cybersecurity and Back-end development**, but I'm not sure exactly about which area I'm going to stay working. Only the time will answer this question... ðŸ‘€
